# Project Setup and Documentation

## Project Structure

```
project-root/
|-- pages/
|   |-- _app.tsx
|   |-- index.tsx
|-- styles/
|   |-- globals.css
```

- **pages**: Contains the Next.js pages for your application.
  - `_app.tsx`: The custom `App` component that wraps around your pages.
  - `index.tsx`: The main page of your application.

- **styles**: Holds global styles for your project.
  - `globals.css`: CSS file containing global styles.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Backend Application:**
   Ensure your backend application is hosted on port 3000.

3. **Configure Frontend Application:**
   Open `pages/index.ts` and configure your API endpoints accordingly.

4. **Run Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- -p 3001
   ```

5. **Access Your Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to access your Next.js application.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that there are no conflicts between the backend and frontend ports.
- Make sure your backend API is accessible from the frontend.

Now, your Next.js frontend should be running on port 3001, connected to your backend on port 3000. Adjust configurations as needed for your specific project requirements.
